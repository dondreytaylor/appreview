                                <h3>Why use AppReview?</h3>
                                <p>Getting a lot of reviews and ratings in the App Store is the goal of anyone with one or many apps in the App Store, but getting them can be difficult. The problem is two-fold-- first,  it can be a daunting task to get showcased, with over 1.5 million apps in the App Store and over 500 being added each day; this makes visibility an uphill battle. Second, there is really not much incentive for app users to review apps. While most people review apps to request features or recommend an app to others, the large majority of people who leave reviews are the ones that have had a bad experience-- <strong>that's where AppReview comes in!</strong></p>
                                <p>AppReview sets out to provide a plateform for both app reviewers and creators, by bringing app reviewers to apps that need reviews through incentives. </p>

AppReview keeps you informed of apps that will pay to get reviewed, by sending you an email or sms when they become available. You can review apps from any device that is capable of accessing the App Store. To get started, it's as simple as signing up and reviewing an app listed.</p>

                            <p>Let's face it, if you launched an app on the App Store, you are well aware of the fact that the apps with the most amount of positive ratings and reviews end up being listed higher within the App Store search results. Reviews help you get your app showcased and can lead to an increase in app installs. To get started, it's as simple as signing up and choosing a package that fits your needs and budget. To add your app, all you will need is your App ID.</p>
